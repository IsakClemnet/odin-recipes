        The key to this recipe lies in the balance of flavors. The saltiness of the soy sauce is complemented by the sweetness of the honey, while the ginger and garlic provide a pungent kick. A touch of sesame oil adds a nutty aroma and richness. This marinade not only enhances the flavor of the steak but also helps to tenderize it, ensuring a juicy and delicious result every time.
