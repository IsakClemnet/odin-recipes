    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Cup All-Purpose Flour</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons Sugar</li>
        <li>1 Teaspoon Baking Powder</li>
        <li>1/2 Teaspoon Baking Soda</li>
        <li>1/4 Teaspoon Salt</li>
        <li>1 Cup Buttermilk</li>
        <li>1 Large Egg</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons Unsalted Butter, Melted</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, egg, and melted butter.</li>
        <li>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Do not overmix; the batter should be slightly lumpy.</li>
        <li>Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat. Lightly grease with butter or cooking spray.</li>
        <li>For each pancake, pour 1/4 cup of batter onto the skillet. Cook until bubbles form on the surface and the edges look set, about 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Flip the pancake and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes, or until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Repeat with the remaining batter, greasing the skillet as needed.</li>
        <li>Stack the pancakes on a plate, top with your favorite toppings, and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
